<h1>Q-Learning</h1>

a) A simple tabular Q learning app for OpenAIGym CartPole v1 model

<br>
b) A simple deep Q learning app with one layer for OpenAIGym CartPole v1 model

  * It works for at least 400000 steps
  
<br>
c) A simple deep Q learning try with PyTorch for OpenAIGym CartPole v1 model
  
  * It doesn't work for more than one layer, It cannot be solved.
  
<br>

d) A simple Policy Gradient application for OpenAIGym CartPole v1 model
  
  * It generally converges and when it converges it works for at least 5000(because I only tried 5000), probably infinite steps. If not converges, run it one more times.
